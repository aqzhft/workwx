# wechat for work

In china wechat play an important role in the current social communication, We can use wechat to improve our work efficiency through appropriate means.  Here are a few of its functions:

1. Identity authentication. The software we developed exists in wechat in the form of h5, when someone click the app, the server will known who you are, this eliminates the need to login with a username and a password.
2. Message notification. This means we don't need to develop a message push system by ourselves, it is important if your app just a web application.

So it also guides us how to use open api wechat provides, we just only need people related and message related api. WeCom is now an independent software, which was originally integrated in wechat. But I don't think we need install a independent software like WeCom, we don't need to use the functions in WeCom, if we implement by oursevles, the user experience will be better.
